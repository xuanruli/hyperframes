name: media-use
description: Agent Media OS, the single skill for every media need in a HyperFrames project. Resolve BGM, SFX, image, icon, or voice into a frozen local file + ledger record (one verb, `resolve`); generate via TTS / music / image models when the catalog misses; produce voiceover, transcription, captions, and background removal through one shared audio engine; operate on media (cut / reframe / transform); and reuse assets across projects. Keeps search noise on disk, hands the agent a path. Use for any audio, image, icon, voiceover, caption, or media-asset need.

# media-use

The media OS for HyperFrames: resolve · generate · operate · remember, every media type, one skill, zero context noise.

## What it owns (the gaps HyperFrames leaves)

HyperFrames owns media _playback_; media-use owns everything else. Each row is enforced by `scripts/lib/coverage.test.mjs` so the claim can't rot.

| HyperFrames gap                            | media-use owns it via                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audio-only, no image/icon                  | `resolve --type image\|icon` (heygen asset search)                                                                                          |
| No voice / audio generation                | `resolve --type voice` + the audio engine (`audio/scripts/audio.mjs`)                                                                       |
| Scattered/duplicated audio engine          | one consolidated engine under `audio/` (hyperframes-media retired)                                                                          |
| No agent media-ops (cut/reframe/transform) | `references/operations.md` + `resolve --from` to register outputs                                                                           |
| No transcript-driven cutting               | `scripts/transcript-cut.mjs` compiles word-timestamp edits into cut lists                                                                   |
| No auto-duck / publish loudness            | `scripts/audio-duck.mjs` + `references/operations.md` loudnorm/sidechain recipes                                                            |
| No cross-project memory                    | global content-addressed cache + auto-promote (`~/.media`)                                                                                  |
| No image generation                        | RAM-graded local mflux (FLUX) via `scripts/lib/mflux-provider.mjs`, codex `image_gen` upsell (`scripts/lib/codex-provider.mjs`)             |
| No video generation                        | spec-gated local LTX (`videogen` in `scripts/lib/local-models.mjs`); `heygen video create` avatar upsell                                    |
| Weak local-model defaults                  | free-usage HeyGen first (TTS, bg-removal) via the `heygen` CLI; local open-source only as an opt-out fallback (`scripts/lib/local-run.mjs`) |

## When to use

Call `resolve` whenever a composition needs media: background music, sound effects, images, icons, or voice. For voiceover / TTS, music, SFX, and caption timing, use the **audio engine** (below); background removal is delegated to the `hyperframes` CLI; transcription defaults to Parakeet (better than whisper.cpp: 6.05% vs 7.44% WER, 5-10x faster) via `scripts/transcribe.mjs`, with whisper.cpp auto-fallback (see `references/operations.md`). For cutting / reframing / transforming existing media, see `references/operations.md`. media-use searches the HeyGen catalog first, freezes the best match locally, registers it in a manifest, and hands the agent one line; all search noise stays on disk.

## Resolve

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --type <type> --intent "<description>" --project <dir>
```

Returns one line: `resolved <id> → <path> (<type>, <metadata>)`

### Types

| Type    | What it finds       | Provider                                 |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `bgm`   | Background music    | HeyGen audio catalog (10k+ tracks)       |
| `sfx`   | Sound effects       | Bundled 19-file library + HeyGen catalog |
| `image` | Photos, backgrounds | HeyGen asset search (75k+ vectors)       |
| `icon`  | Icons, logos        | HeyGen asset search (type=icon)          |
| `voice` | TTS voiceover       | Local Kokoro (free); HeyGen TTS upsell   |

### Examples

```bash
# Background music
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --type bgm --intent "upbeat tech launch" --project .
# → resolved bgm_001 → .media/audio/bgm/bgm_001.mp3 (bgm, 25s)

# Sound effect
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --type sfx --intent "whoosh" --project .
# → resolved sfx_001 → .media/audio/sfx/sfx_001.mp3 (sfx, 0.57s)

# Image
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --type image --intent "gradient tech background" --project .
# → resolved image_001 → .media/images/image_001.jpg (image)

# Icon
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --type icon --intent "rocket" --project .
# → resolved icon_001 → .media/images/icon_001.png (icon, transparent)
```

### Flags

| Flag            | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type, -t`    | Media type: bgm, sfx, image, icon, voice                        |
| `--intent, -i`  | What you need (natural language)                                |

| `--from`        | Freeze a local file or direct public URL (ingest)               |
| `--local-only`  | Offline: skip every network provider (cache + local only)       |
| `--provider`    | Force one generator (e.g. `codex`, `mflux`, `kokoro`, `heygen`) |
| `--adopt`       | Bulk-import existing assets/ into manifest                      |
| `--json`        | Output JSON instead of one-line result                          |

## Providers

media-use holds no keys; every external tool owns its auth. Generation is
local-first with a cloud upsell where one helps. `resolve` spec-checks
AVAILABLE RAM and auto-picks the best local model that fits (a RAM-graded
ladder, `describeModelLadder`); the agent can see the ladder and override.

| Type          | Provider (in order)                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bgm/sfx       | heygen catalog (free)                                                                   |
| image         | heygen search, then local mflux (best FLUX for your RAM), then codex `image_gen` upsell |
| voice         | local **Kokoro** (free, on-device), then **heygen tts** paid upsell                     |
| icon          | heygen asset search                                                                     |
| video (local) | local LTX (`videogen` ladder); `heygen video create` avatar upsell                      |

Local Kokoro (voice), mflux (image), and LTX (video) run on-device (free,
private, offline once cached). Paid/cloud upsells sit behind them: HeyGen TTS
for voice, the `codex` CLI (ChatGPT sub) for a better image, the `heygen` CLI
for avatar video. Cost rule (X4): the agent confirms before an agent-initiated
paid call; a user-requested one just runs.

To force a specific generator (e.g. a user says "make this image with codex"),
pass `--provider codex`: it pins resolution to that provider and skips the
free-first default. See `references/operations.md` for the RAM ladders and
upsell recipes.

`--local-only` skips every network provider, including the free HeyGen ones,
leaving the project + global cache and any local provider.

## How it works

1. Check project `.media/manifest.jsonl` for exact-prompt match
2. Scan existing `assets/` directory for unregistered files matching the need
3. Check global cache `~/.media/` for reusable asset
4. Search via provider (HeyGen audio catalog, HeyGen asset search)
5. Freeze file to `.media/<type>/`, register in manifest, regenerate `index.md`

The agent gets back **one line**. Candidates, scores, provenance stay on disk.

## Adopt existing projects

Most HyperFrames projects already have assets in `assets/`. media-use adopts them:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --adopt --project .
# → adopted 9 assets from assets/
#   bgm_001 → assets/bgm/mango-fizz.mp3 (bgm, 146.6s)
#   image_001 → assets/images/avatar.jpg (image, 400×400)
```

`ffprobe` extracts real duration and dimensions. During resolve, unregistered files in `assets/` matching the intent are adopted on the fly.

## Reading the inventory

After resolve or adopt, read `.media/index.md` for the full inventory:

```
# .media · 4 assets

id         type   dur   dims       path                          description
bgm_001    bgm    25s   -          .media/audio/bgm/bgm_001.mp3  upbeat tech launch
sfx_001    sfx    0.6s  -          .media/audio/sfx/sfx_001.mp3  whoosh
image_001  image  -     1920×1080  .media/images/image_001.jpg   gradient tech background
icon_001   icon   -     200×200    .media/images/icon_001.png    rocket
```

## Cross-project reuse

Assets are cached automatically on resolve. Every resolved/ingested asset is auto-promoted to the global cache at `~/.media/`, so subsequent resolves for the same prompt, in any project, hit the cache with no re-download and no provider call.

## Files

- `.media/manifest.jsonl`: machine SSOT, one JSON record per line
- `.media/index.md`: agent-readable table (id, type, dur, dims, path, description)
- `~/.media/`: global cross-project reuse cache (content-addressed, SHA-256)

## Audio engine: voiceover, music, SFX, captions, transcription

For a full audio pass (TTS voiceover + background music + sound effects in one
shot), use the shared engine at `audio/scripts/audio.mjs`. It takes a neutral
`audio_request.json` and writes `audio_meta.json` plus assets under
`.media/audio/{voice,bgm,sfx}`:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/audio/scripts/audio.mjs --request ./audio_request.json --out ./audio_meta.json
```

- **Request** `{ provider?, lang?, speed?, lines: [{ id, text, sfx?: [names] }], bgm: { mode?, query?, prompt? } }`: `id` joins each line back to your model; `bgm.mode` = `retrieve | generate | none` (omit for auto). `--only tts,bgm,sfx` runs a subset and merges into an existing `--out`.
- **Output** `audio_meta.json` (id-keyed): `voices[].{path,duration_s,words[]}` (word timestamps for captions), `sfx[]`, `bgm`, `total_duration_s`.
- **Auto-degrades on one switch**: HeyGen credential present → HeyGen TTS + music/SFX retrieval; absent → ElevenLabs/Kokoro TTS, Lyria/MusicGen BGM generation, and the bundled SFX library (no credential needed).
- If BGM took the generate path (`bgm_pending: true`), run `audio/scripts/wait-bgm.mjs` before final render.

Single-shot helpers: `audio/scripts/heygen-tts.mjs` (one voice file). Transcription / background removal / captions use the `hyperframes` CLI (`transcribe`, `remove-background`), see the per-topic guides in `audio/references/` (`tts.md`, `bgm.md`, `sfx.md`, `transcribe.md`, `remove-background.md`, `captions/`).

## Operating on media (cut, reframe, transform)

media-use resolves + remembers; for **operating** on assets see
`references/operations.md`: local-tool recipes (ffmpeg trim/reframe/montage,
auto-editor, scenedetect) and the local-vs-HeyGen transform table (background
removal, upscale, lipsync, translate). Run the tool, then register the output
with `resolve --from <output> --type <type>` so it joins the ledger + global
cache.

## CLI tools used (what to run, and how to enable each)

`resolve` auto-cascades; each provider shells one CLI. Local tools are OPT-IN:
if a local tool is absent, resolve degrades gracefully to the free/cloud path,
so nothing here is strictly required except `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`. Install a local
tool to unlock its free, private, on-device path. media-use holds no keys.

| Tool               | Serves                                                                   | Install                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` | adopt probing, cut, duck bake, loudnorm                                  | system package (`brew install ffmpeg`)                                                                              |
| `heygen`           | catalog (bgm/sfx/image/icon), TTS + avatar upsell                        | `curl -fsSL https://static.heygen.ai/cli/install.sh \| bash` then `heygen auth login --key <key>` (needs >= v0.1.6) |
| `mflux-generate`   | local image gen (FLUX), best-for-RAM                                     | `uv venv ~/.venvs/mflux && VIRTUAL_ENV=~/.venvs/mflux uv pip install mflux==0.9.6`                                  |
| `codex`            | image gen upsell (ChatGPT sub)                                           | Codex CLI, logged in via ChatGPT (owns its own auth)                                                                |
| `parakeet-mlx`     | local transcription (default ASR, best)                                  | `uv venv ~/.venvs/parakeet && VIRTUAL_ENV=~/.venvs/parakeet uv pip install parakeet-mlx`                            |
| `ltx-2-mlx`        | local video gen                                                          | `git clone https://github.com/dgrauet/ltx-2-mlx && cd ltx-2-mlx && uv sync --all-extras`                            |
| `npx hyperframes`  | Kokoro TTS (voice), whisper.cpp (transcribe fallback), remove-background | bundled with the hyperframes CLI                                                                                    |

The RAM-graded local-model shortlist + exact per-tier install/invoke lives in
`scripts/lib/local-models.mjs` (the agent can read `describeModelLadder(cap, specs)`
to see which model fits this machine). Without a tool on PATH, its provider
prints a one-line diagnostic to stderr and resolve falls through to the next
provider (e.g. no `mflux` -> codex image upsell; no `parakeet-mlx` -> whisper.cpp).

`heygen asset search` is a pre-launch command hidden from `heygen --help`, but it
runs; providers tag requests with the allowlisted `X-HeyGen-Client-Source` header
(v0.1.6+).

## Telemetry

`resolve` and the edit tools (transcribe / transcript-cut / audio-duck) send an
anonymous usage event to PostHog (`scripts/lib/telemetry.mjs`), so we can see
which capabilities are actually used. It records only the media TYPE, the
resolution SOURCE, and the winning PROVIDER: never the intent text, file names,
or paths, and `$ip:null` so no IP is stored. Best-effort and non-blocking (a
resolve never waits on or fails from telemetry).

Opt out with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (also off in CI and
dev). Same public PostHog project key and opt-outs as the `hyperframes` CLI.
